# Classic Snake Game

Welcome to the Classic Snake Game repository! This project features a classic Snake game implemented using Python's Turtle module. The game has been Dockerized to simplify deployment and ensure a consistent development environment.


## Features

- Classic Gameplay: Enjoy the traditional Snake game where you control the snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.
- Turtle Graphics: Uses Python's Turtle module to create and manage the game graphics.
- Dockerized: The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy setup and consistent execution across different environments.
## Technologies Used
- Python (3.x): The primary programming language used to develop the game.
- Turtle Module: Utilized for rendering the game graphics and handling user input.
- Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent environments and easy deployment.
## Prerequisites

- Python (3.x): Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the official website.
- Docker: Install Docker from the official website. Docker will help you containerize and run the application easily.
